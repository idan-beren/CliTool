# YAML-Based Action Runner CLI

A **C# command-line tool** for running workflows defined in **YAML files**.
This tool is designed to be **extensible, structured, and developer-friendly**, making it easy to automate tasks, integrate external services, and control execution flow with **variables, conditions, retries, imports, and more**.

## üìÇ YAML Structure

A workflow YAML file is simply a **list of actions**. Each action has a `Type` and its own parameters.

### üîπ What is an Action?

An **action** = a single executable step in the workflow.
Examples: logging a message, waiting for a duration, calling an API, or running a shell command.

### üîπ Example Workflow

```yaml
Actions:
  - Type: Log
    Message: "Hello-World!"
    
  - Type: Delay
    Duration: 100
    
  - Type: Assert
    Condition: "1 + 2 == 3"
  
  - Type: Http
    Method: GET
    Url: "https://www.google.com"
      
  - Type: SetVariable
    Name: Price
    Value: 100
    
  - Type: PrintVariable
    Name: Price
  
  - Type: Parallel
    Actions:
      - Type: Log
        Message: "Task A"
      - Type: Log
        Message: "Task B"
        
  - Type: Retry
    Times: 3
    Action:
      Type: Log
      Message: "Retrying..."
  
  - Type: Shell
    Command: echo hello-world!
      
  - Type: Condition
    Condition: "{{Price}} == 100"
    Then:
      - Type: Log
        Message: "True"
    Else:
      - Type: Log
        Message: "False"
        
  - Type: Import
    Path: ./Yaml/ImportedActions.yaml
```
